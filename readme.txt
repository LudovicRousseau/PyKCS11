Current version should be compiled using SWIG 1.3.27.
Using 1.3.28+ an error similar to may be generated by the compiler:

src\win32_pykcs11_wrap.cpp error C2440: 'static_cast' : 
                     cannot convert from 'char *' to 'unsigned char *'

The precompiled wrapper included in distribution is being generated
using SWIG 1.3.27.

If in Windows the linker complains that the Python24_d.lib doesn't exists
Please edit the "SWIG-Install-Dir\Lib\python\python.swg" file and replace
following line:
#include "Python.h"

with following code:
#ifdef _DEBUG
  #undef _DEBUG
  #include "Python.h"
  #define _DEBUG
#else
  #include "Python.h"
#endif

This prevents the linker to try to link against the debug version of python lib
that doesn't come with the standard distribution.


History
"""""""

1.2.4 - April 2012, Ludovic Rousseau
	- improve epydoc documentation
	- add pinpad support in C_Login() using pin=None
	- add pinpad support in samples getinfo.py and dumpit.py
	- add createObject()

1.2.3 - December 2010, Ludovic Rousseau
	- Add new classes CK_SLOT_INFO, CK_INFO, CK_SESSION_INFO,
	  CK_MECHANISM_INFO and CK_TOKEN_INFO instead of the low level ones
	  to have a __repr__() method.  It is now possible to just print an
	  object of these classes and have a human readable version.
	- Add a new class CK_OBJECT_HANDLE() to replace the low level one
	  and have a __repr__() method for objects returned by findObjects()
	- Move initToken() from class Session to class PyKCS11Lib and add a
	  slot parameter.
	- Add generateKeyPair and destoryObject support in high level
	  interface

1.2.2 - June 2010, Ludovic Rousseau
	Debug low level C_GenerateRandom
	Add seedRandom() and generateRandom() in the high level API

1.2.1 - November 2008, Ludovic Rousseau
	Use src/opensc/pkcs11.h instead of src/rsaref/* files since the
	 files from RSA are not free enough (no right to distribute modified
	 versions for example)
	improve samples/getinfo.py script
	bug fixes

1.2.0 - August 2008, Ludovic Rousseau
	add getMechanismList() and getMechanismInfo()
	add Session().getSessionInfo()
	bug fixes

1.1.1 - December 2006, Giuseppe Amato (Midori)
	bug fixes

1.1.0 - August 2006, Ludovic Rousseau
