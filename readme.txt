Current version should be compiled using SWIG 1.3.27.
Using 1.3.28+ an error similar to may be generated by the compiler:

src\win32_pykcs11_wrap.cpp error C2440: 'static_cast' : 
                     cannot convert from 'char *' to 'unsigned char *'

The precompiled wrapper included in distribution is being generated
using SWIG 1.3.27.

If in Windows the linker complains that the Python24_d.lib doesn't exists
Please edit the "SWIG-Install-Dir\Lib\python\python.swg" file and replace
following line:
#include "Python.h"

with following code:
#ifdef _DEBUG
  #undef _DEBUG
  #include "Python.h"
  #define _DEBUG
#else
  #include "Python.h"
#endif

This prevents the linker to try to link against the debug version of python lib
that doesn't come with the standard distribution.
