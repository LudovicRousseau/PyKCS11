############## the keys were generated and stored on the card ###############


# At this point your keys are in the card, the private key is marked as
# non-exportable.
# To add a certificate, you have to prepare a CSR in PKCS#10 format and sign
# it with the key.
# It can be done with OpenSSL by typing the commands below in a terminal
# 1. openssl
# 2. engine dynamic -pre SO_PATH:/usr/lib/engines/engine_pkcs11.so -pre ID:pkcs11 -pre LIST_ADD:1 -pre LOAD -pre MODULE_PATH:libacospkcs11.so
# 3. req -engine pkcs11 -keyform engine -key 0:1 -new -text -out /tmp/newcert.csr -subj "/O=users/CN=Test User"
# Note that `-key 0:1` means "use slot 0, with key id 1"
# The CSR will be printed to stdout and saved to /tmp/newcert.csr


# The CSR is sent to a CA, which will issue a certificate and send it back.
# Once you have the certificate, it has to be converted to BER (if it isn't
# already). It will be assumed that the raw data of the certificate are in
# `cert`.

# keep in mind that certain elements, such as the subject, must not be
# passed as a string, but as an ASN1-encoded structure. Consider using
# pyasn1 to do that, see http://pyasn1.sourceforge.net/
